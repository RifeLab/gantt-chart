## Rife Lab Gantt Chart

This is a fork of a project developed by the [Hill Lab](https://github.com/HillLabSask/HillLab_gantt_chart) and inspired by [Marcel Ramos](https://rpubs.com/mramos/ganttchart).

The chart is updated and posted in our lab every year to track the comings and goings of people. 

The R package is plotrix. The plot generated is pretty basic and so we do a little polishing of the PDF result that we print and post on the lab webpage https://research-groups.usask.ca/hilllab/people.php
