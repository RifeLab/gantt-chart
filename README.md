## Rife Lab Gantt Chart

This is a fork of a project developed by the [Hill Lab](https://github.com/HillLabSask/HillLab_gantt_chart) and inspired by [Marcel Ramos](https://rpubs.com/mramos/ganttchart).

The chart is updated and posted in our lab every year to track the comings and goings of people.
